A meta package manager inspired by rebos

Features i want to implement:
  - Managers
    - User-defined
    - Ordering
    - Current state dynamically determined by managers
    - Maybe user-defined additional options
  - Configs
    - Modular
    - Different machines
  - No generation tracking, should be handled by git
